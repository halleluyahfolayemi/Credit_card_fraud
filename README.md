## Summary Statement on Fraud Activity

Fraud activity within SecureBank Nigeria's dataset is characterized by a low but specific incidence rate (0.00031%). The primary threat vector is domestic online transactions conducted via desktop computers. The prevalence of decline codes 6 and 12 indicates that fraudsters are likely attempting to use invalid or stolen card data through trial and error. Contrary to standard expectations, local transactions pose a higher verified risk than international ones, suggesting a need to tighten security protocols for domestic web based payments.
